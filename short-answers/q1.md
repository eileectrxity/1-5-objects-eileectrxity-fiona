# Question 1

When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer by Eileen

A good time to use an array instead of an object is when order matter so that one can easily use the indexed positions to refer to an element.

Meanwhile, a goodtime to use an object is when readability matters, for example, referencing person.name is better and more descriptive than referencing person[0].
