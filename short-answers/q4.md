What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

# Answer

# `.JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation)

is a data format thatâ€™s commonly used by web developers for transferring data between a server and a web application.

  

For example, an application written in Java can easily send JSON data to a Python application. JSON is an easily transferrable and flexible format

___________

In order for JSON to be valid:

  

- Keys must be strings, enclose with the "double quotes"

- Values that are strings must also be encased with "double quotes"

- Arrays are used in [square brackets]

- Objects are used in {curly braces}

- Only simple data types are allowed: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null

  

___

### The reason that the example is not a valid JSON file is because the keys are supposed to be in "double quotes"
