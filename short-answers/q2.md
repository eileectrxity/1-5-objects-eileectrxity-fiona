# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
# `Pass by Value` means :
  > a copy of the code is made
  >
  > Changes to the copy don't affect the original data. 
  >
  > Therefore, this means that it is immutable. 
  >
  > `Primitive types` like numbers, strings, and booleans are passed by value

# `Pass by Reference` means :
> changes to the reference affect the original data 
>
>Objects and arrays are passed by reference.
