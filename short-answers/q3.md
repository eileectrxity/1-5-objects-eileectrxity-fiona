# Question 3

What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer by Eileen

A shallow clone is a copy of an array, where only the top-level structure is cloned while the nested-level structure shares reference with the original.

This means that the top-level structure of an array is copied and passed by value, so changes made to the new array will not affect the original array.

Shallow clones can cause bugs because the nested-level structure is copied and passed by reference. Therefore, the original and copied nested structures reference the same things in memory. Hence, changes made to the copied nested-level structures are reflected in the original array.
